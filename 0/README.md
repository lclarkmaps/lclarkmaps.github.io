# Audio Maps

This code is a template for creating location-based audio tours that can be viewed (and listened to) on a computer or on a phone. Like any website, it consists of HTML and Javascript. It uses a recent Javascript library that let us do advanced things with maps called [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) and open source map tiles from [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/styles/).

By editing `markers.js`, you can assign longitude and latitude coordinates to an audio file that you upload. This will then appear on the map as a marker. If you click the marker, the sound will play. Furthermore, if you are on your phone, the sound will play when you are physically present at that location (the hotspot is a 50ft radius around the point you specify -- but you can change this). 

This map is running at [https://lclarkmaps.github.io/0].
